								<h2>Summary Of India Vs South Africa ODI Series</h2>
								<p>The ODI series of India and South Africa was more of a skirmish rather than a battle. AB De Villiers, Hashim Amla, Dale Steyn and the whole South African team literally demolished the Indian Team's bowling attack and batting order. The big names in the SA team were the highlight of the series giving the Indian fans something to enjoy while watching the contests. All in all, India should not look back on this series and focus more on the upcoming Test series. 
                                                        </p>

										<h3>Football Player of the Week: Philippe Coutinho</h3>
										<p>Philippe Coutinho, the Liverpool striker proved his worth after he scored the winner against Chelsea on Saturday. The goal was a mixture of skill and presence of mind. He knew where the goalkeeper was standing and placed the ball in the gap between the keeper and the post. This is why he is the football player of the week.</p>

								<h3>Chelsea's Catastrophe</h3>
								<p>Liverpool ruined Chelsea's unbeatable record at home. This was Chelsea's first home loss to Liverpool in a very long time. Josè Mourinho was absolutely angry with his team. After shaking hands with Liverpool Manager, Juergen Klöpp, Mourinho stormed off into the dressing room ready to grill his team. Chelsea started very nicely with a brilliant header from Ramires, from there Chelsea just lost it. With two goals from the brilliant Coutinho, Liverpool snatched the game right under Chelsea's nose. A brilliant win for Liverpool but an embarassing defeat for Chelsea.</p>
